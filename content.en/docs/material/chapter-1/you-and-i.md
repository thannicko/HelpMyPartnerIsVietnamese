# You & I in Vietnamese

When in doubt, you can always use the literal translation of "You" and "I" in Vietnamese when speaking:

| English  | Vietnamese |
| -------- | -------    |
| You      | Bạn        |
| I        | Tôi        |

These are neutral pronouns, can be applied with anyone, and corresponds 1-to-1 with the English versions in usage & meaning.

> [!WARNING]
> **Warning:** 
> While this works in most cases, you _will_ sound robotic as these are not common pronouns in Vietnamese.
