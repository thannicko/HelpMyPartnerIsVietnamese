# Chapter 4: Past, present & future

This chapter equips you with the grammatical background to construct sentences in the past, present, and future:
* [The present](#the-present)
* [The future](#the-future)
* [The past](#the-past)

## The present

Before we start, let's understand the formula we're going to use to construct most of our sentences.

{{< badge value="Example" >}} Let's look at a few example sentences. Try to identify the common structure in them (do not worry about vocabulary for now).

| English               | Vietnamese            | Audio                                           |
| --------              | -------               | -------                                         |
| Tôi ăn bánh mì        | I eat banh mi         | {{< audio src=chapter1-audio/t-rex-roar.mp3 >}} |
| Em uống cà phê        | I drink coffee        | {{< audio src=chapter1-audio/t-rex-roar.mp3 >}} |
| Con đi Đà Lạt         | I go to Da Lat        | {{< audio src=chapter1-audio/t-rex-roar.mp3 >}} |

If you've identified it, well done! The common structure is:

```
[your pronoun] [verb] [object of verb]
```

## The future

{{< badge value="Example" >}} Let's do the same exercise as above, try to identify the common structure in the below sentences.

| English                   | Vietnamese                 | Audio                                           |
| --------                  | -------                    | -------                                         |
| Tôi sẽ ăn bánh mì         | I will eat banh mi         | {{< audio src=chapter1-audio/t-rex-roar.mp3 >}} |
| Em sẽ uống cà phê         | I will drink coffee        | {{< audio src=chapter1-audio/t-rex-roar.mp3 >}} |
| Con sẽ đi Đà Lạt          | I will go to Da Lat        | {{< audio src=chapter1-audio/t-rex-roar.mp3 >}} |

You've probably spotted it by now. Adding "sẽ" in front of the verb will turn the sentence into future tense. No conjugation needed!

{{< badge style="info" value="Vocabulary" >}} "Sẽ" = "will"

## The past

{{< badge value="Example" >}} You know the drill by now, identify the common structure in below sentences.

| English                   | Vietnamese                 | Audio                                           |
| --------                  | -------                    | -------                                         |
| Tôi đã ăn bánh mì         | I did eat banh mi          | {{< audio src=chapter1-audio/t-rex-roar.mp3 >}} |
| Em đã uống cà phê         | I did drink coffee         | {{< audio src=chapter1-audio/t-rex-roar.mp3 >}} |
| Con đã đi Đà Lạt          | I did go to Da Lat         | {{< audio src=chapter1-audio/t-rex-roar.mp3 >}} |

Same as the future tense, adding "đã" in front of the verb will turn the sentence into past tense. Again, no conjugation needed!

{{< badge style="info" value="Vocabulary" >}} "Đã" = "did"
