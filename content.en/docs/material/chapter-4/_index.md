# Chapter 4: The present

This chapter equips you with the grammatical background to construct sentences in the present, together with some common verbs to begin talking:
* [The present](#the-present)

## The present

Before we start, let's understand the formula we're going to use to construct most of our sentences.

{{< badge value="Example" >}} Let's look at a few example sentences. Try to identify the common structure in them.

| English                                                                          | Vietnamese            | Audio                                           |
| --------                                                                         | -------               | -------                                         |
| Tôi ăn {{< tooltip title="bánh mì" >}}Vietnamese baguette{{< /tooltip >}}        | I eat banh mi         | {{< audio src=chapter1-audio/t-rex-roar.mp3 >}} |
| Em uống {{< tooltip title="cà phê" >}}Vietnamese coffee{{< /tooltip >}}          | I drink coffee        | {{< audio src=chapter1-audio/t-rex-roar.mp3 >}} |
| Con đi {{< tooltip title="Đà Lạt" >}}A tourist city{{< /tooltip >}}              | I go to Da Lat        | {{< audio src=chapter1-audio/t-rex-roar.mp3 >}} |

If you've identified it, well done! The common structure is:

```
[your pronoun] [verb] [object of verb]
```

Now, look at the examples again and see if you can identify the verb for "eat", "drink", and "go".

> [!NOTE]
> **Review:**
> We've used "tôi", "em", and "con" in the examples. They're all variations of "I". Can you recall what the differences are between these and when we use them?
