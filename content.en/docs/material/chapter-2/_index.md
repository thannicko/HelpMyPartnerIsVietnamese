# Chapter 2: Greetings & saying your name

This chapter contains:
* [Greetings](#greetings)
* [Saying your name](#saying-your-name)

This section deals a lot with pronouns, so if you haven't yet, please read [chapter 1](docs/material/chapter-1).

## Greetings

{{< badge style="info" value="Vocabulary" >}} "Hello" = "Chào"

### Greeting one (1) person

We've learned in [chapter 1](docs/material/chapter-1) about how to refer to yourself & others. You can greet a person using this phrase:

```
[your pronoun] chào [the other's pronoun]
```

{{< badge value="Example" >}} You are chatting with an older guy, he's around your brother age.
```
You: Em chào anh
Him: Anh chào em
```

### Greeting everyone at once

If you're in a room with your partner's family, you don't want to greet everyone individually. We're going to apply the same phrase above with one new word.

{{< badge style="info" value="Vocabulary" >}} "Mọi người" = "Everyone"

So we've figured out the "everyone" part, but to complete the phrase, we still need to pick the pronoun for ourselves:

* "con", if most of the audience seems like "cô/chú/ông/bà"
* "em" if most of the audience seems like "anh/chị"

```
["Con" or "Em"] chào mọi người
```

# Saying your name

To say your name, you can use:
```
[your pronoun] tên [your name]
```

{{< badge style="info" value="Vocabulary" >}} "Tên" = "Name" (do not worry about the grammar aspect for now)

{{< badge value="Example" >}} Continuing our example, you will now introduce your name to the older guy you've met.

```
You: Em tên Bob     <- Notice how we use "em" here as that's the counterpart for "anh"
Him: Anh tên Frits  <- And he uses the pronoun for "older brother" to refer to himself"
```
