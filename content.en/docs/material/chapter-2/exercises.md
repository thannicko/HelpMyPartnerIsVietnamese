# Exercises

These exercises are to simulate conversation. How this works:

* If the speaker is not `You`, you can play the audio: this simulates what your conversational partner might answer.
* If the speaker is `You`, speak the phrases required in the situation out loud by yourself _without_ playing the audio. Afterwards, check your answer by playing the audio.

In each exercise, greet the person, and tell them your name. We use for now the name "Bob" for all our answers.
