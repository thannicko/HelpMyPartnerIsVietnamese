# Common pronouns

## Cultural background

In Vietnamese daily conversations, an important first step is picking the appropriate pronouns to use with your conversational partner. Why? Because Vietnamese pronouns are linked to the ages of speaking partners relative to each other.

Therefore, unlike the English "you" and "I", in Vietnamese, a person can have different pronouns, depending on who they're talking to.

> As you age, the pronouns people pick to refer to you will also be different!

## Common pronouns

This section will present the most commonly-used pronouns.

> [!TIP]
> **Tip:** 
> When in doubt, pick the younger pronouns. You want to avoid implying that the other person is too old. This could, in some cases, be unpleasant to the receiver.

We mentioned before that pronouns can change depend on who you're talking to. Let's look at an example:

* You see a middle-aged lady on the street, she's likely 10-20 years than you => "cô" for the other & "con" for you
* You _are_ the middle-aged lady on the street, someone 10-20 years younger than you approaches => "con" for the other & "cô" for you
