- ## What This Curriculum Is
  This is intended to get you speaking Southern Vietnamese in a natural way (as the Vietnamese do), and to understand enough Vietnamese to get your way around Vietnam.

- ## What This Curriculum Is Not
  This is not intended to get you fluent in reading or writing. We'll cover reading & writing just enough to serve the purpose of surviving in Vietnam.
